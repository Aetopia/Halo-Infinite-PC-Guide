> [!CAUTION]
> SKIF's doesn't exclusively inject into games but rather into any process that uses a graphics API and deals with input which means it could potentially trigger anticheats in other games. <sup><a href="https://wiki.special-k.info/SpecialK/Global#technical-info">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wiki.special-k.info/SpecialK/Global#multiplayer-games">[2]</a></sup><br>
