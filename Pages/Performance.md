## Aggressive Dynamic Resolution Scaling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Supported Platforms**
> - [x] Steam
> - [x] Microsoft Store

> [!NOTE]
> You may refer to [Visual Quality Tweaks](#visual-quality-tweaks) to fix any quality issues caused by aggressive dynamic resolution scaling.

We may abuse the `Minimum Framerate` option for better performance.
By setting the value to `960` FPS, dynamic resolution scaling becomes insanely aggressive providing noticable performance gains.

1. Open the `SpecControlSettings.json` file depending on your platform:<br>

    |Platform|Filepath|
    |-|-|
    |Steam|`%LOCALAPPDATA%\HaloInfinite\Settings\SpecControlSettings.json`|
    |Microsoft Store|`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.254428597CFE2_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Local\HaloInfinite\Settings\SpecControlSettings.json`|

2. Set the following key-value pair to the following:<br>
    ```js
    "spec_control_minimum_framerate": {
        "version": 2,
        "value": 960
    },
    "spec_control_target_framerate": {
        "version": 1,
        "value": 960
    } 
    ```
    **Make sure to set the in game sharpness to 100% for visiblity.**

3. Results:
    - **No Minimum Framerate**<br>
